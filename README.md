# Plans

- [ ] Test tracking feedback with silicon oil sample in normal holders with thin walls.
    - [ ] It is possible to manipulate particles with free current
    - [ ] Sequency with current feedback
    - [ ] Sequency with Mg field feedback (probably the set point field is incorrect)
    - [ ] Current feedback with tracking
    - [ ] Current feedback with tracking and scaling
- [ ] From the data, draw a force field map

- [ ] Manipulate in some biomatrix using normal holders
- [ ] Video saving option
- [ ] Redesign the microscopy table based on the proto
- [ ] Design of suitable holders for normal and cell experiments
- [ ] Integrate better physical model to the setup

# Daggis

### 230517

Finished the moving of set-up to upstairs, and rebuilt it. Everything seems to new work as upstairs. Yet, the model scaling needs to be tested with real particles.
